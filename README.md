#	Nearest Prime

In order to avoid thundering herd problems, and just for fun, I like to use prime numbers in config files and cron jobs.

This small utility takes a number returns the nearest primes.

If given a prime, it returns 3 numbers: The nearest lesser prime, itself, and the nearest greater prime

If given a non-prime, it returns 2 numbers: nearest lesser prime, and nearest greater.
